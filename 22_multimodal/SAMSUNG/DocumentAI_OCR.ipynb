Donut does not require off-the-shelf OCR engines/APIs, yet it shows state-of-the-art performances on various visual document understanding tasks, such as visual document classification or information extraction (a.k.a. document parsing). In addition, we present SynthDoG 汾ｶ, Synthetic Document Generator, that helps the model pre-training to be flexible on various languages and

We then utilize an instruction tuning framework to train our model learn the mapping from the text instruction to the corresponding image with either the specified style or the style of the surrounding texts in the background. Such a training method further brings our model the zero-shot generalization ability to the following three scenarios: generating text with unseen font variation, e.g. italic and bold, mixing different fonts to construct a new font, and using more relaxed forms of natural language as the instructions to guide the generation task.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### **Setting**"],"metadata":{"id":"V826ZMLwKhpx"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!unzip /content/DocumentAI_OCR.zip"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"xOilW8PRM909","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1692254196526,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":6816,"user":{"displayName":"ｰｱぞｸｰ","userId":"07015587273030351036"}},"outputId":"06109d20-a779-455d-d911-8275e31f655b"},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Archive:  /content/DocumentAI_OCR.zip\n","replace DocumentAI_OCR/.DS_Store?
